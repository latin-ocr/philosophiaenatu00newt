’l‘ Mr. Barrow hnth refign‘d his Lesture's Place to one Mr. Neweon of Cambridge whom he
menti-ons in his Optic pre-:face as a very ingenious Person: one who hath ‚ before Mr. Mertator's
Logarithrnotechnia was extant, invented the same Method‚ and applied it generally to all Cur·
ves, and dwers ways to the Circle. , ⁷

τ ln September 1668. ΜΓ. Mercator publiih'd his Logarithmotechni2‚ containing a Specimen of
this Method, (that is, of Infinite Series) in one only Figure, to wit in the Quadrature of the
Hyperbola. 'Not long after the ssool( carne out, 1 sent one of them to Dr. Wallis at oxford
who forthwrrh gave his sense of it m the Philos. Tranfaetions : another of them 1 sent to Dr,
Barrow at Cambridge, who forthwhh sent me up some Papers of Mr. Newton, who is fince becoss
me the Doe‘tor‘s Successor in the Mathematical Leftures there. By which, and former commu·
nications made thereof from the Author to the Doeton it appears that the said Method was in=
vented sorne— Years before by the said Mr. Newton ‚ and generally anplied: so that thereby in any
Cnrvrlinear l-‘igure propos’d, that is determin'd by one or more common Properties by the sa-
rne Method may be obtain'd the Quadrature or Area of the said Figure, accurately 'when it can
be done , but-always infinitely τηεψ-ς the Evolution , οι· Length of the said ί urve Line· the Cen-
tre of the Frgure; ‘its round Sohds made by Rotation , and their Surraces; and an'perform’d
without any Extratfhon of Roots.
